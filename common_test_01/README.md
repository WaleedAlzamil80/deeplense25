## Common Test I - Multi-Class Classification

This repository contains my solution to **Common Test I** of the DeepLense project for GSoC 2025. The task involves classifying images into three different lensing categories using **PyTorch**.

### ðŸ“Œ Task Overview
The goal is to train a model that classifies images into one of three classes:
- **No substructure**
- **Subhalo substructure**
- **Vortex substructure**

The dataset was preprocessed using **min-max normalization**, and I explored data augmentation techniques to improve performance.

### ðŸ›  Model and Approach
I fine-tuned a **Vision Transformer (ViT-Tiny)** for this classification task. The training setup included:
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Pretrained **ViT-Tiny (patch16, 224)**
  - Fully connected layers: `1000 â†’ 128 â†’ 3`
  - Batch Normalization and Dropout (p=0.5) for regularization
- **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr = 1e-5, weight decay = 2e-4)
- **Learning Rate Scheduler:** ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=5)
- **Batch Size:** 256
- **Number of Epochs:** 150
- **Augmentations Applied:**
  - CenterCrop (100) â†’ Resize (224)
  - Random Horizontal & Vertical Flips (p=0.5)
  - Random Rotation (30Â°)
  - Normalization (mean=0.5, std=0.5)
  - As gravitational lensing images come from astronomical observations, and their color/brightness is physically meaningful, we didn't use ColorJitter, but we may give it a try to see it's impact on training.
